            <p>I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
                I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The
                 next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</div>

            <p> I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big

            <p class="quote"> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
                learning from their experiences was easy</p>
            <p>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence 
                necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
                 You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.</p>

            <p class="quote"> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
            <p>  Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
                 me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things 
                 about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
                  for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                   no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
                    It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
